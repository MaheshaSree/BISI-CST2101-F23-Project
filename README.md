# BISI-CST2101-F23-Project

**Overview**
Welcome to the Diabetes Analysis Project! This project focuses on exploring and analyzing diabetes data within the context of the Pima Indians tribe. The dataset includes information about Pima Indian females aged at least 21 years, aiming to shed light on various aspects of diabetes susceptibility and potential contributing factors.

**Project Structure**
Notebook: The primary analysis is conducted in the provided Jupyter notebook.
Data: The dataset used for this analysis consists of records from the Pima tribe, focusing on relevant features related to diabetes.

**Objectives**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and feature analysis. Understand patterns, distributions, and potential correlations within the data.
2. Model Training: Build a classification model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on relevant features. Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results.
